# Store Wayfinder
A portable device that helps retail stores customers navigate and locate merchandises.

## Components
There are 2 main components to the project  
1. A user interface  
2. A camera controlled by a Raspi

## Design
The users could add their shopping list to the device, and the device would guide them to the items.  
The camera is used to track the user's location within the store for better navigation using computer vision.
